| Component        | Feasibility Analysis                                                                                 |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Frontend         | React is mature, supports PWA features, offline caching, responsive UI. ✅                            |
| Backend          | Node.js + Express is scalable, supports REST APIs, JWT, cron jobs, and integrates with MySQL. ✅      |
| Database         | MySQL supports relational data (users, medicines, schedules), transactions, and analytics queries. ✅ |
| Authentication   | JWT for secure stateless authentication is well-supported. ✅                                         |
| Notifications    | Push (Firebase), Email (NodeMailer/SMTP), SMS (Twilio) are all implementable. ✅                      |
| OCR              | Tesseract.js (frontend) or Python OCR via API integration is feasible. Optional but doable. ✅        |
| Stock Prediction | Basic predictive analytics using historical data + linear regression. Can scale later. ✅             |
| PWA Support      | React + Workbox enables offline support, installable app, caching strategies. ✅                      |

## 2. Operational Feasibility

| Factor          | Feasibility                                                               |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| User base       | Primarily individuals and families; system scales well horizontally. ✅    |
| Maintenance     | Modular architecture with separate frontend/backend makes updates easy. ✅ |
| Admin oversight | Optional admin role manageable; minimal intervention needed. ✅            |
| Notifications   | Push/email/SMS setup is reliable; cron jobs handle scheduling. ✅          |

## 3. Economic Feasibility

| Factor               | Analysis                                                                                          |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Development Cost     | Low to moderate using free/open-source stack (React, Node.js, MySQL). ✅                           |
| Hosting              | Can use VPS (Ubuntu + NGINX + PM2 + MySQL) or cloud (AWS/GCP/Heroku). Moderate cost. ✅            |
| Third-party services | Notifications (Firebase free tier), Twilio for SMS (paid), OCR API (optional, some free tiers). ✅ |
| ROI                  | Useful for users managing medicines, high adoption potential, low maintenance costs. ✅            |

## 4. Schedule Feasibility

* 3–4 months development for 1–2 developers:

  * Requirement & Design: 2 weeks
  * Frontend + Backend Core: 6–8 weeks
  * Notifications & Analytics: 2 weeks
  * OCR + Reports: 2 weeks
  * Testing + Deployment: 2 weeks

## 5. Risk Analysis

| Risk                    | Mitigation                                                     |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Push/email/SMS failures | Use reliable providers and test cron jobs thoroughly.          |
| OCR inaccuracies        | Optional feature; fallback to manual input.                    |
| Stock prediction errors | Use simple linear regression first; improve with ML later.     |
| Data security           | Enforce HTTPS, JWT, input validation, and database encryption. |
